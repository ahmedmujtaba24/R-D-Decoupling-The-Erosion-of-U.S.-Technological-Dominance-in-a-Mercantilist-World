# 📊 R&D Decoupling: The Erosion of U.S. Technological Dominance in a Mercantilist World

This repository contains the full workflow, methodology, and supporting materials for my submission to the **Bridgewater x Global Citizen – Forecasting the Future Challenge**.  
The project investigates **U.S.–China R&D decoupling**, shadow-economy dynamics, and implications under a mercantilist framework.

## ⚙️ Methodology

1. **Data Imputation** — Multi-source reconciliation and imputation for missing values.  
2. **Econometric Modeling** — MIMIC-style/structural approach linking shadow economy, fiscal dominance, and tech decoupling.  
3. **Forecasting** — Out-of-sample validation with binary event predictions and error analysis.  
4. **Visualization** — Clean, reproducible plots for replication and review.

## 🚀 Reproducibility

- **Languages/Tools:** R, Python, Google Earth Engine  
- **How to run:** See code and notes within each folder’s `README`/script headers.  
- **Data:** Public sources + processed intermediates (where licenses permit).
